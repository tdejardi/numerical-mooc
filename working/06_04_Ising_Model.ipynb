    "Take a piece of iron at room temperature and subject it to a strong magnetic field (either using a permanent magnet or an electromagnet). After a while, switch off the magnetic field. You will observe that the piece of iron now acts itself  like a magnet. This property is shared by ferromagnetic materials which are able to sustain a non-zero magnetisation without any external field. However, this property vanishes above a certain temperature. This temperature is called the Curie temperature $T_c$, and depends on the ferromagnetic material considered. For iron,  $T_c$ is 1043 K. In thermodynamic terms we say that the ferromagnetic material undergoes a phase transition at the critical temperature $T_c$ since its properties change abruptly at that temperature.\n",
